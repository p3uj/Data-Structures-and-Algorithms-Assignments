# Instruction: 
Solve the 3 problems below using Python programming language.

## 1. Find the largest three distinct elements in an array.
Given an array with all distinct elements, find the largest three elements:

Given:
arr = [20, 30, 89, 1, 67, 44, 78]

## 2. Move all zeroes to end of array.
Given an array of random numbers, push all the zeroes of a given array to the end of the array.

Given:
arr = [23, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 15, 45, 0, 32, 0, 57]

For example, if the given array is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}.
The order of all other elements should be same.

## 3. Count nodes in Circular linked list
Given a circular linked list, count the number of nodes in it.

Given: (Variable name is up to you)
{5, 9, 11, 17, 35, 57, 83}

For example, the output is 5 for the below list.
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
